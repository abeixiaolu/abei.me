Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Artsmp "[abeixiaolu](https://github.com/abeixiaolu)".

I'm passionate about **web technologies**, continuously expanding my knowledge
in areas like technology, finance, and entrepreneurship. I love sharing
insights and collaborating with others. That's why I give talks and write
articles. I also stream on Twitch, where I work on projects, try out new
tools, and explain various concepts.

I favor simplicity over complexity when creating user experiences. I focus
on details to deliver the best possible product that pleases both the
client and the user.

Thus, I've developed expertise in JavaScript <IconTag icon='i-logos-javascript' text='JavaScript'/>, <IconTag icon='i-logos-typescript-icon' text='TypeScript'/>, <IconTag icon='i-logos-vue' text='Vue'/>, <IconTag icon='i-logos-nuxt-icon' text='Nuxt'/>, <IconTag icon='i-logos-react' text='React'/>, <IconTag icon='i-logos-nextjs-icon' text='Nextjs'/>,
which aids me in thoroughly understanding the client's needs and proposing the best solutions.
